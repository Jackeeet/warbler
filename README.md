# warbler

**warbler** is a programming language with bird-inspired syntax.

## Versions

The latest **warbler** version is **0.0.1**.

This language is not meant to be used in any kind of serious project (*at least for now*).

## Features

**warbler**'s key features are:

- ```:>``` bird-inspired syntax ```<:```
- static typing
- local variable type inference (like ```var``` in C#)
- optional types
- pattern matching

More features are to come in the future.

## License

**warbler** is licensed under the **MIT License**.

## Disclaimer

At this point, **warbler** is a tiny side-project. 

Its main purpose for me is to learn how to make programming languages and try to implement things I like in languages like C#, Haskell and Python.

If you find **warbler** interesting, feel free to use it in your own projects or contribute something new.
